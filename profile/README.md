# LOAM – Lab of Advanced MRI @ UNICAMP

Welcome to the **LOAM (Lab of Advanced MRI)** GitHub repository. We are part of the **Neurophysics Group** in the **Department of Cosmic Rays and Chronology (DRCC)**, within the **Institute of Physics (IFGW)** at the **University of Campinas (UNICAMP)**, Brazil.

## 🧠 About the Lab

Established in **February 2023** and led by **Prof. Dr. André Paschoal**, LOAM is dedicated to the **implementation, development, and optimization of advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences**, with applications in **neuroimaging**.

Our research currently focuses on:

* **Brain hemodynamics**
* **Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clearance mechanisms**
* **Their implications in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders**

## 🧪 Facilities & Equipment

LOAM operates across two main locations at UNICAMP:

* **Institute of Physics (IFGW)**
* **University Hospital (HC – Hospital de Clínicas)**

We have access to **state-of-the-art MRI scanners**, including:

* **Philips Ingenia 3T** (clinical research)
* **Bruker BioSpin 7T** (preclinical research)

These resources allow us to conduct both **human and animal studies** using cutting-edge imaging protocols.

## 🌎 About UNICAMP

The **University of Campinas (UNICAMP)** is a leading public university in Brazil, located in **Campinas**, a major city in the state of São Paulo, just one hour from São Paulo city.

UNICAMP is known for its excellence in:

* **Humanities**
* **Exact Sciences**
* **Biological Sciences**

Its **main campus** houses a broad range of undergraduate and graduate programs, as well as the **University Hospital**, where part of our research activities are carried out.
